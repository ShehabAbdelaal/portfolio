Specs of my portfolio website:

I will create a web app called Shehab Abdelaal.
Which wll contain a homepage, about page, contact page & articles page.

In the articles page i will be adding weekly articles with the possibilty=y for users to comment on the articles.

I might add another page to allow users to write journals about themselves & their achievments.

In the about page i will write my story from the beginning in the form of a vertical timeline with photos & comments
included, as i continue adding more things when i learn new things.

in the contact page it will be a static page with links to my social media, phone number & email. with a photo
of me in the bacground.

The homepage will have a brief description of the website.
